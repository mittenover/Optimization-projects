# Optimization-projects
This repository contains my code and reports for two projects completed as part of the optimization courses at **ENSTA Paris** during the first year of my **Master's in Applied Mathematics**.

- One project focuses on solving the **chain problem**.
- The other project involves **image deblurring**.
